# Aim:
To generate continuous and discrete waveforms for the following:
1. Unit Impulse Signal
2. Bipolar Pulse Signal
3. Unipolar Pulse Signal
4. Ramp Signal
5. Triangular Signal
6. Sine Signal
7. Cosine Signal
8. Exponential Signal
9. Unit Step Signal
# Theory:
1. Unit Impulse Signal:
• A signal that is zero everywhere except at one point, typically at t=0 where its value
 is 1.
• Mathematically δ(t) ={∞ ; t=0
 0 ; t ≠0}
2. Bipolar Pulse Signal:
• A pulse signal that alternates between positive and negative values, usually
rectangular in shape. It switches between two constant levels (e.g., -1 and 1) for a
defined duration.
• Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise
3. Unipolar Pulse Signal:
• A pulse signal that alternates between zero and a positive value. It remains at zero
for a specified duration and then jumps to a positive constant level (e.g., 0 and 1).
• Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise (assuming A is positive)
4. Ramp Signal:
• A signal that increases linearly with time.
• Mathematically r(t) ={ t ; t≥0
0 ; t<0}
5. Triangular Signal:
• A periodic signal that forms a triangle shape, linearly increasing and decreasing with
time, typically between a positive and negative peak.
• Mathematically: Λ(t) = 1 - |t| for |t| ≤ 1, Λ(t) = 0 otherwise
6. Sine Signal:
• A continuous periodic signal. It oscillates smoothly between -1 and 1.
• Mathematically: y(t)=Asin(2πft)

7. Cosine Signal:
• A continuous periodic signal like the sine wave but phase-shifted by π\2.
• Mathematically: y(t)=Acos(2πft)
8. Exponential Signal:
• A signal that increases or decreases exponentially with time. The rate of growth or
decay is determined by the constant a.
• Mathematically: e^(at)
9. Unit Step Signal:
• A signal that is zero for all negative time values and one for positive time values.
• Mathematically u(t) ={ 1 ; t≥0,
 0 ; t<0}
