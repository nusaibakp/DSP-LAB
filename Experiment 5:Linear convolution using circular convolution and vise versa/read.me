2. To perform Circular Convolution using Linear Convolution.
Theory:
Performing Linear Convolution Using Circular Convolution
Method:
1. Zero-Padding:
o Pad both sequences x[n] and h[n] with zeros to a length of at least 2N-1,
where N is the maximum length of the two sequences. This ensures that the
circular convolution will not wrap around and introduce artificial
periodicity.
2. Circular Convolution:
o Perform circular convolution on the zero-padded sequences.
3. Truncation:
o Truncate the result of the circular convolution to the length N1 + N2 - 1,
where N1 and N2 are the lengths of the original sequences x[n] and h[n],
respectively.
Example:
 Consider the sequences x[n] = [1, 2, 3] and h[n] = [4, 5].
1. Zero-padding:
o Pad x[n] to [1, 2, 3, 0, 0] and h[n] to [4, 5, 0, 0].
2. Circular Convolution:
o Perform circular convolution on the zero-padded sequences. The result
will be
[4, 13, 21, 15, 0]. 
3. Truncation:
o Truncate the result to [4, 13, 21, 15].
 This result is the same as the linear convolution of x[n] and h[n].
Performing Circular Convolution Using Linear Convolution
Method:
1. Zero-Padding:
o Pad both sequences x[n] and h[n] to a length of at least 2N-1, where N is
the maximum length of the two sequences.
2. Linear Convolution:
o Perform linear convolution on the zero-padded sequences.
3. Modulus Operation:
o Apply the modulus operation to the indices of the linear convolution result,
using the period N. This effectively wraps around the ends of the sequence,
making it circular.
Example:
Using the same sequences as before, x[n] = [1, 2, 3] and h[n] = [4, 5].
1. Zero-padding:
o Pad x[n] to [1, 2, 3, 0, 0] and h[n] to [4, 5, 0, 0].
2. Linear Convolution:
o Perform linear convolution. The result will be [4, 13, 21, 15, 0].
3. Modulus Operation:
o Apply the modulus operation to the indices: [4, 13, 21, 15, 0] becomes [4,
13, 2, 15, 0].
