# Aim:
To find linear convolution of following sequences with and without built in
function.
1. x(n) = [1 2 1 1]
 h(n) = [1 1 1 1]
2. x(n) = [1 2 1 2]
 h(n) = [3 2 1 2]
# Theory:
Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to combine two signals to produce
a third signal. It's a fundamental operation in signal processing and systems theory.
Mathematical Definition:
Given two signals, x(t) and h(t), their linear convolution is defined as:
 y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫ 𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭−𝛕) 𝐝𝛕

Applications:
Filtering: Convolution is used to filter signals, removing unwanted frequencies
or noise.
System Analysis: The impulse response of a system completely characterizes its
behaviour, and convolution can be used to determine the output of the system
given a known input.
Image Processing: Convolution is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring,
and sharpening images.
